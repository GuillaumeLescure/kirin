    2nd is a station and has a departure time > keeping it
    3rd is a station but has no departure nor arrival time > NOT interesting
    4th is a station (no typeArret is a station) and has departure/arrival times > keeping it
    5th is a station, doesn't have arrival time but we keep it as there is arrival time later in 7th
        (travelers are able to hop on, then hop off later) > keeping it
    6th is not a station > NOT interesting
    7th is a regular final traveler stop > keeping it
    8th is a station, doesn't have arrival time nor do the following stops > NOT interesting
    9th is in the same situation than 8th > NOT interesting
